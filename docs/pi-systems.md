 π-systems

Piraeus is a communications system which allows subsystems or agents to interconnect.  That is possible because the subsystems share variables between each other, i.e., the output of one subsystem is the input to another.  This variable sharing implies  interconnected subsystems have an intersection in their respective  σ-algebras, an event shared between the subsystems.  The importance of π-system is that if the subsystems agree on the π-system, then they agree of the  σ-algebra that generated the π-system.

A π-system in Piraeus is where the subsystems "agree" either by sending or receiving from the π-system and thus the intersected event common in the subsystems respective σ-algebras, which establishes interconnection.
